# Hello,
# 
# This is a Selenium WebDriver project using Java language.
# The Framework used was personally made using many different fonts.
# 
# This project automated some of Rakuten web pages functionalities like:
# - Search by product;
# - Add products to cart and proceed until payment method in checkout page;
# - Login page validations;
# 
# This project has room for improvements like:
# - Some of the tests use "hardcoded" elements and they could be furder improved to dynamic elements based on parameters;
# - The parameters are "hardcoded" in the TestSuit while they could be furder improved to read values from data files;
# - While the project has a Listener that consolidate and show you the Test result it could also generate a "Status Report" in an HTML page;
# - Logs with more details and also Print Screen in case of failure;
# 
# Notes:
# - The browser used for this automation was Chrome, at 'demo\rakuten\src\main\resources' you will find the driver for the latest version at the moment (68.0.3440.106)
# - The project was created and test using Windows 10 machine.
# 
# I hope can enjoy :)
